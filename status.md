Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, we layed out  the framework for our project. We constructed a mock template for the dichotomous key, started organizing branch structure, and started figuring out how we are going to distinguish and categorize the dinosaurs for the key. We have also started looking at how to incorporate renPY into our project.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We still have to code our project, however figuring out the steps for our dichotmomous key was more important so that was our focus to start.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Pur main problem at the start of hte project was how to start the dichotomous key and figuring out how detailed we wanted it to bee. There are over 700 unique dinosours and we couldn't do a key with that many. At the same time, doing it with only 10-15 wouldn't be enough. We needed to find the proper inbewtween and ended up deciding on breaking it down into subgroups.
